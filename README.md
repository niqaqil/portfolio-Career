### ❓ About This Repository

This public repository serves as the "front door" to my portfolio. Its primary purpose is to direct visitors and recruiters to the live-action website.

The website itself is built using the **Academic Pages (Jekyll)** theme and is deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

### 🔒 Source Code

To maintain a clean public profile and manage development, the complete source code for the website is hosted in a **separate, private repository**. This showcase repo does not contain the site's source code.
